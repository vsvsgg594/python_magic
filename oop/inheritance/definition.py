# Python Inheritance
# Inheritance allows a class (child class) to acquire properties and methods of another class (parent class). It supports hierarchical classification and promotes code reuse.

# Types of Inheritance:
# Single Inheritance: A child class inherits from a single parent class.
# Multiple Inheritance: A child class inherits from more than one parent class.
# Multilevel Inheritance: A child class inherits from a parent class, which in turn inherits from another class.
# Hierarchical Inheritance: Multiple child classes inherit from a single parent class.
# Hybrid Inheritance: A combination of two or more types of inheritance.
