# Operators for Sets
# Sets and frozen sets support the following operators:

# Operators	Notes
# key in s	containment check
# key not in s	non-containment check
# s1 == s2	s1 is equivalent to s2
# s1 != s2	s1 is not equivalent to s2
# s1 <= s2	s1 is subset of s2
# s1 < s2	s1 is proper subset of s2
# s1 >= s2	s1 is superset of s2
# s1 > s2	s1 is proper superset of s2
# s1 | s2	the union of s1 and s2
# s1 & s2	the intersection of s1 and s2
# s1 – s2	the set of elements in s1 but not s2
# s1 ˆ s2	the set of elements in precisely one of s1 or s2

s1={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
s2={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,12,13,14,15,16,17}

# if s1==s2:
#     print("s1 is equal to s2")
# else:
#     print("s1 is not equail to s2")  
# if s1!=s2:
#     print("s1 is equal to s2")    
# else:
#     print("s1 is not equal to s2")    

# check subset
# if s1<=s2:
#     print("s1 is subset of s2")
# if s1>s2:
#     print("set1  is superset of s2")   
# else:
#     print("s1 is not subset of s2")     
# if s1.issuperset(s2):
#     print("yzsckjkzljxc zckj")
